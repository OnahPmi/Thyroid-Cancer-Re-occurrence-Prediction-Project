# Thyroid-Cancer-Re-occurrence-Prediction-Project

**This Repository contains the code base of our study titled: `Optimizing Unsupervised Feature Engineering and Predictive Models for Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction.`**

**The code base is divided into two scripts.**
1. **`EDA dimensionality reduction Exploration`**, where we explored the various dimensionality reduction techniques to find the optimal ones for the modelling pipeline. 
2. **`Predictive model building`**, where we built the models using the optimal dimensionality reduction techniques identified in (1).
